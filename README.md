## üöÄ Getting Started

These steps will set up the quiz and database on your system.

### 1. Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PostgreSQL installed and available via `psql` command

### 2. Run the Setup

Run the setup script:

```bash
python setup.py
```

The setup script will:

- Check if PostgreSQL is installed
- Ask you for your PostgreSQL username, password, host, and port
- Create the database `python_quiz`
- Import the data from `data/quiz_dump.sql`
- Create a `config.py` file in `game_files/` with your credentials

If PostgreSQL is installed on your system, 
but the setup.py can't find it, try this on Windows:

1. Find your PostgreSQL `bin` directory (e.g. `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\bin`)
2. Add that folder to your system PATH:
   - Open *System Properties* ‚Üí *Environment Variables*
   - Under *System variables*, select `Path` ‚Üí *Edit* ‚Üí *New*
   - Paste the full path to the `bin` directory
3. Restart your terminal and start the setup.py again

### 4. Start the Quiz

After setup, run the main quiz script:

```bash
python main.py
```
